This folder is dedicated to my friend and business partner Ben Bennington. He came to me with this idea to calculate a lagrangian, or the maximum utility in imports and exports based on what he was learning in his economics and higher math classes. This webapp allows a person to determine the maximum amount they should spend on any two products they are buying based on the utility of each product.

We still are learning how to graph our results, but that is the next step.
